BUEditor Plus for Drupal 7

This module provides expanded control over the popular BUEditor module for Drupal (http://drupal.org/project/bueditor).

By default BUEditor displays on most textareas. You can control which editor appears via roles, paths and
element IDs. BUEditor Plus overrides that default behavior and gives you better control over which textareas
the editor appears on. Now you create profiles and assign those profiles to text fields in Drupal's field system.
Not only that, but BUEditor Plus allows you to assign different editors based upon text format. You can create
a "Full HTML" editor and a "Filtered HTML" editor in BUEditor. Then in your profile assign those editors to their
associated input format. Now when you change input formats for a textarea the editor will automatically change to
the proper one for that format. You can even set a format to "none" to not have an editor appear with that input
format.

BUEditor Plus removes the roles checking used by the actual BUEditor module. Instead editors are chosen based upon
input formats, which already have role control. The default path and element ID visibility settings in BUEditor are
still enforced in BUEditor Plus, making it possible to assign alternative editors to each input format.

For usage instructions please see the included README.txt file in the module folder.
